A fully functioning software reproduction of a real, physical computer. 

A virtual machine (VM) abstracts underlying hardware resources of CPU, memory, harddisk, display, and network into software to mimic a physical computer including its installed operating system. Multiple "guest" virtual machines can co-exist and even run at the same time on a single "host" computer. Since virtual machines are purely digital, they have all the advantages of digital assets: you can upload/download, clone (copy), undo, diff (compare), and manipulate programmatically.

In software engingeering and computer science, virtual machines may also refer to software-defined computing environments designed to run a single program or process thereby enabling the program to run identically across different computing hardware architectures without modification. The virtual machine, rather than the program, is customized to each architecture.
