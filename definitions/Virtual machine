A fully functioning software reproduction of a real physical computer or computing environment. 

A virtual machines (VM) abstracts underlying hardware resources of CPU, memory, harddisk, display, and network into software to mimic a physical computer including its installed operating system. Multiple "guest" virtual machines can co-exist and even run at the same time on a single "host" computer. Since virtual machines are purely digital, they have all the advantages of digital assets such as ability to upload/download, clone (copy), undo, diff (compare), and manipulate programmatically. 

In computer science circles, virtual machines may also refer to software-defined computing environment designed to run a single program thereby enabling a program to run identically  across different computing hardware without modification.
