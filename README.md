## A glossary for GitMachines

A collection of pleasant, readable definitions of terms and processes in GitMachines accreditation-ready virtual machines. Based on Eric Mill's United States Glossary. Designed for integration in various user-facing applications.

Ease of understanding is the #1 priority. Precision and completeness are #2.

### Guidelines

Definitions are stored in text files, one per file. The name of the entry is the filename (no extension).

The first line is a short, single sentence definition. It should be possible to form a small, light glossary by using the first sentence of every entry.

A longer definition can follow, with paragraphs separated by two line breaks.

The longer definition can use links, but the text should hold up even if the links are stripped out. It should be possible to form a rich glossary using the full text of every entry, whether or not HTML is an option in the user's environment.

### Examples

The words "Vagrant box" refers to a virtual machine image that can be programmatically configured by the software called Vagrant.

In file "Vagrant box":

> A virtual machine image that automatically launches, configures itself, and installs software from the web according to a set of instructions. 

> Vagrant boxes are generally 340MB to 500MB and consist of a basic operating system like Linux or Ubuntu. Most do not include the GUI elements of an operating system because developers tend to use Vagrant boxes to mimic server production environments.
