## A glossary for ELitED (Energy Literacy EDucation)

A collection of pleasant, readable definitions of terms and processes in GitMachines accreditation-ready virtual machines. Based on Eric Mill's United States Glossary. Designed for integration in various user-facing applications.

Ease of understanding is the #1 priority. Precision and completeness are #2.

### Guidelines

Definitions are stored in text files, one per file. The name of the entry is the filename (no extension).

The first line is a short, single sentence definition. It should be possible to form a small, light glossary by using the first sentence of every entry.

A longer definition can follow, with paragraphs separated by two line breaks.

The longer definition can use links, but the text should hold up even if the links are stripped out. It should be possible to form a rich glossary using the full text of every entry, whether or not HTML is an option in the user's environment.

### Examples

The words "Green Button" refers to the symbol and initiative of providing individuals and business with machine-readable data of their historic and current energy usage.
